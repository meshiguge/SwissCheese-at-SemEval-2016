# SwissCheese-at-SemEval-2016

Requirements

- Python 2.7
- Tensorflow = 0.10
- Numpy
- jieba

this is the code of paper, SwissCheese at SemEval-2016 Task 4: Sentiment Classification Using an Ensemble of Convolutional Neural Networks with Distant Supervision. I realize the core idea of the paper, which means that it can not be used in a real environment. If you know TensorFlow, I am sure it is easy to be rewritten so that it meets your requirements in real environment.

If you know Chinese, you can get more details from [this blog](http://www.jianshu.com/p/4bb889f88632).
