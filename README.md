# SwissCheese-at-SemEval-2016

Requirements

- Python 2.7
- Tensorflow = 0.10
- Numpy
- jieba

This is a convolutional neural network(CNN) implementation with 2 layers, similar to SwissCheese at SemEval-2016 Task 4: Sentiment Classification Using an Ensemble of Convolutional Neural Networks with Distant Supervision. I realize the CNN 
architecture of the paper, which means that I do not implement the distant supervised step, Sorry :(.
